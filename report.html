      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church had an inaccurate belief of astronomy, and three astronomers, including Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Joseph Settle did some real discovering. Copernicus had some great discoveries for astronomy, as he discovered heliocentrism, there were problems as well. Along with Copernicus, there were two other scientists involved in this conflict as well. The whole point here is to prove that the church is wrong, and that the real theory is heliocentrism, not geocentrism.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geocentrism is what the Roman Catholic Church believed. Geocentrism is when the Earth is in the center, and the Sun rotates around it and the moon rotates around it as well. The Earth does not move around at all. However, the reason the Church believes this is because they want all the humans to be in the center so that is why they believe in geocentrism. They didn’t even look through any telescope. The problem with geocentrism is that if it was true, then Earth would be the only planet in the universe. Yes, Earth is the only planet with gravity, oxygen, and living things, but there is more than that. With geocentrism and 8 planets, there would have to be 8 suns. According to Nicolaus Copernicus, the real fact about space is called heliocentrism. Heliocentrism is when all of the planets rotate around the sun, and all the moons rotate around their planets. The way all of the other 7 planets, which are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were discovered, was because of heliocentrism. There is only one sun, and if there were nine suns, the universe would be too big.</p>
      <p><span id="u520-5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Revolutions</span> is a book by Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus did not fully confirm to publish that book. However, Copernicus was convinced by Georg Rheticus to publish that book. (SEOP Copernicus 2.3) Copernicus’s dream was to see the book, and he saw it in 1543, and only a few hours after that, Copernicus died. Copernicus dedicated his book, <span id="u520-7">On the Revolutions,</span> to the pope. The pope hated the book, because it offended the church’s belief of geocentrism, so the church made a fact that it wasn’t true about Copernicus’s discoveries. The book was not fully accurate about heliocentrism, so the church didn’t ban it right away, they banned the book in in 1616. People weren’t allowed to discover further about heliocentrism.</p>
      <p>In 1616, when the church banned the book, Galileo Galilei was issued an injunction by the church saying he wasn’t allowed to discover more about heliocentrism, and spread more information. Galileo later, he used his telescope, and he found other planets,</p>
     </div>
     <div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u521-21"><!-- content -->
      <p>and he believed in heliocentrism, which is true. He slightly proved Copernicus’s discovery, but a conflict came to him too. Galileo had a trial by an inquisition in 1633. From that trial, he was close to being charged due to heresy, because he broke the injunction given to him by the church. The inquisition wanted to know what Galileo’s intentions were. The inquisition also wanted to know whether Galileo was innocent or guilty. Galileo had to go to Rome, and the inquisition gave him a small time to go to Rome and if he did not do those requirements, he would have to go to jail. Galileo had to prove himself wrong publicly. After Galileo died, Pope Urban VIII didn’t fully approve of him getting a proper burial at a church. Later, it was requested to move his burial to another location. There was a third astronomer to make discoveries in the year of 1820. The third astronomer was given proper permission from the Roman Catholic Church to be able to make those discoveries. The astronomer was named Joseph Settle. Settle also used a telescope to make those discoveries. He saw another planet, and he told that the Earth and all of the other planets rotated around the sun. He also said that all of the moons rotate around their planets.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the discoveries of the truth of Astronomy, it took a total of 3 astronomers. The Astronomers were Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Joseph Settle. Copernicus made the discovery first, he wrote a book but the church hated it, and Copernicus’s discoveries were not fully accurate. Galileo saw that book, not following the injunction the church gave him, discovered it again, and he had even worse consequences than Copernicus. Later in 1820, Joseph Settle did the final discovery with approval of the church. It is not really understandable why it took three astronomers to do this type of discovery which is actually true.</p>
